My name is Doug Issichopoulos, and I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com/) (after they acquired [Lacework](https://www.lacework.com/) in mid 2024). In 2023, I pursued a master's degree in computer science from UIUC where I focused primarily on distributed systems and machine learning. Prior to that I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Humanyze](https://www.humanyze.com). My undergraduate major was mathematics (Stanford '12), so it should be no surprise that I strive to write code that resembles a great math proof: easy to read, elegant, and water-tight.

This website is a repository of posts on some of my personal software projects that I believe could be useful to others and/or demonstrate a particularly fun intersection of computer science and mathematics.
