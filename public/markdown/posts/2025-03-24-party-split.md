## Motivation
You don't have to believe me, but I'm going to say it anyway: I had the idea for Venmo before it ever came out. You're out to dinner with a friend, your friend pays saying, "We'll even up later." You don't have cash, and you definitely don't have exact change, but sometime later (hopefully) you pay my friend back. "Wouldn't it be nice if I could just do some sort of electronic funds transfer directly to my friend now?" thought I many moons ago.

Some years later, Venmo shows up to save the day!

Don't get me wrong, it's one thing to have a good idea; it's another thing to actually build it. I could not have built Venmo back then, and it's unlikely I could build it even now. That said, while Venmo and similar apps have been around for a while now, all this time there has been another problem that doesn't seem to have been solved yet: **how much do I even owe you**?

The problem gets even more complicated when you're at a dinner party with 10 people. Most of the time one or more people get short-changed. Every once in a while someone takes the receipt, writes up a spreadsheet, parses everything out, get's called a nerd and/or cheapskate, eventually sends out a series of Venmo requests for the (mostly maybe) precise amount, and then becomes the hero.

After a few of these occurrences recently, I finally set out to solve this problem once and for all. The time was right because now OpenAI is at our disposal to parse the receipt for us.

I'm working on productizing this application now, but for the moment, I wanted to share a proof-of-concept demonstration of it with you all.

Soon you too can be the hero.
