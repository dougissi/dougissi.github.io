## Motivation
Over 10 years ago, my friend Austin Trinkle threw out an idea to me: could I make an app to help people memorize the Bible? For it to really work, it would need to give customized, immediate feedback to users' recitations. Back then, it was just a dream. But thanks to incredible advancements in AI and tools like OpenAI’s latest models and APIs, that dream now seems possible.

## Proof-of-Concept Application
I’ve just built a proof-of-concept for an AI memorization partner called Memorize With Me, and I’m excited to share it with you! Check out the video below for a quick demo 🎥 

This PoC focuses on Bible memorization, the original inspiration for the idea. But imagine the possibilities:
* 🎭 Helping actors memorize their lines for theatrical performances.
* 🎓 Assisting students with speeches or key points for exams.
* 📝 Supporting professionals learning critical scripts or presentations.

While I’m thrilled by how far this concept has already come, this is just the beginning. There’s still a long way to go to turn it into a fully-fledged product, and I’d love your feedback:
* Does this sound like a tool you (or someone you know) would use?
* What other use cases do you see for something like this?
* Should I take the next steps to productize it?

Huge thanks to OpenAI and the broader AI community for enabling developers like me to bring ideas like this to life. Let me know what you think—I’d love to hear your thoughts!
